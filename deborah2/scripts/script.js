She passed away on August 19th, 2014 from breast cancer. Throughout her life she achieved many great things and has inspired many, including me. Her influence as a woman working in the male-dominated world of postwar design was revolutionary. Deborah remains an icon in graphic design, even posthumously. She was one of the first big environmental graphic designers, and paved the way for future women in design. On Deborah and Paul’s website, Deborah’s excellence is described in the beginning paragraph of her page:</p><p><div class="it"><i>Deborah Sussman is recognized as a pioneer of environmental graphic design for creating arresting visual imagery and designing its highly imaginative applications for architectural and public spaces. Her passion for the marriage of graphics and the built environment, fueled by her early career at the Eames Office, has led to collaborations with planners, architects and clients.</i></div></p><p>She was exposed to art at a young age. She struggled choosing between becoming an actress, or become involved with art and design. Her father was a skilled commercial artist, which most likely influenced her interest in design. In an interview with Deborah, when asked about her background in design, she stated:</p><p><div class="it"><i>“I grew up in Brooklyn where my parents exposed us to the arts from a young age: we had dance lessons, piano lessons, French lessons, trips to museums, performances and galleries. After high school I went to study painting and acting at Bard College in New York, which was a very radical school at that time. In those days I thought I’d become an actress or an artist but then I heard about a school in Chicago, the institute of design, ran by László Moholy-Nagy and I really wanted to go there and see what it was all about. I got transferred to Chicago and design completely took over my life from then on.</i></div></p><h1>1940&#39s- More Education</h1><p>She attended Art Students League in Manhattan, NYC. At the school, there were no grades or degree programs. The school had amateur and professional artists, and focused on providing high quality art education at an affordable price. Some artists even worked there full-time, despite the lack of accreditation. The school was founded in 1875 by a group of artists, many of which were women. There were a number of famous artists who have been instructors, lecturers, and students at the League. They include Georgia O’Keefe, Roy Lichtenstein, and Mark Rothko.</p> <div class="it"><i>“Founded in 1875 by artists and for artists, the Art Students League of New York has been instrumental in shaping America’s legacy in the fine arts. Many renowned artists have honed their skills at the League, which is dedicated to sustaining the great tradition of training artists. Today, more than 2,500 students of all ages, backgrounds and skill levels, study at the League each month.”</i></div><p>Deborah’s attendance to the League tells us a few things about her. First, it shows that she has an ambition to learn. She wants to become the best designer she can be, so she went to get additional art learning experiences. Secondly, it shows that she’s not afraid to jump right into design and art, even in a world that may not be ready for women designers. Her ambition is what helped her get to where she was at the point o her death: an iconic graphic designer.</p><p>The League is still going on today, and is still run by artists, for artists. There are still no degrees or curriculum, and one comes only for the pursuit of art, for the desire to understand artistic thinking and process, and to discover what that understanding can bring.</p></div><div class="image-holder"><div class="image1"><img src="http://media.interiordesign.net.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/6711-feb383facdfc1d5b1c9348ea772850b6.jpg"><p class="caption"><i>Deborah Sussman</i></p></div></div></div>');

Black Mountain College was created to pursue a new type of progressive education. It was completely different from every other type of college and university to exist. The website for Black Mountain College describes it as this:</p><div class="it"><i>“It was owned and operated by the faculty and was committed to democratic governance and to the idea that the arts are central to the experience of learning. All members of the College community participated in its operation, including farm work, construction projects and kitchen duty. Located in the midst of the beautiful  North Carolina mountains near Asheville, the secluded environment fostered a strong sense of individuality and creative intensity within the small College community.”</i></div><p>At Black Mountain College, she received career-defining art and performance tuition from Merce Cunningham, John Cage, and Franz Kline.<p><h1>1950’s - Bard College</h1><p>Later, she attended Bard College, a private liberal arts college. Established in 1860, the institution consists of a liberal arts college, a conservatory, and eight graduate programs offering over 20 graduate degrees in the art and sciences. The college has a massive network spanning twelve cities, five states, seven countries, and four continents. It has beautiful scenery, and it is the 38th best liberal arts college in the United States. She studied painting there as well, and acted in student productions. Acting was one of her passions, but ultimately chose design over her ambitions as an actress.</p><p>Her Junior year, she decided to transfer to the “New Bauhaus” at the Illinois Institute of Technology (fig. d). She was originally going to only stay there a short while, but ended up staying for three years. IIT is located in Chicago, and has programs in engineering, science, psychology, architecture, business, communications, industrial technology, information technology, design and law. This school is where Deborah was scouted by Ray and Charles Eames, as mentioned here:</p><div class="it"><i>“At IIT, Sussman accumulated mentors, including the Swiss trained Hugo Weber (1918-1971) and the visionary architect and engineer Konrad Wachsmann (1901-1980). Skilled at drawing and gifted at model-making, Sussman stood out from her peers and was soon recruited by Charles Eames, who visited the school in 1953. For Sussman, the opportunity to work with the Eamses was ‘like being told you’re going to heaven and you’re to live there.’”</i></div></div><div class="image-holder"><div class="image1"><img src="https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KJ555_1015AR_16H_20150918153226.jpg"><p class="caption"><i>The Studies Building, which students helped build in the early ’40s</i></p><img src="http://socialstudies.bard.edu/index.php?action=getfile&id=242296&disposition=inline&type=image"><p class="caption"><i>Bard College</i></p></div></div></div>')

The Fulbright scholarship was a competitive award given to artists to study their craft abroad. Ulm school for design is only second to the Bauhaus for the most influential design school. The school was focused on progressive designing in the 50’s and 60’s and a pioneer in the study of semiotics, which is the connection of form to meaning and how that relates to design and communication. The school closed after only 15 years, because of the nature of the institution. Since it was an experimental institution, there were numerous changes in the content, organization of classes, and continuing internal conflicts which eventually influenced the decision to close the college.</p><div class="it"><i>“It differed fundamentally in a programmatic way. The intention of the HfG founders was not to succeed the Bauhaus. Walter Gropius put the Dessau Bauhaus under the motto: “Art and technology – a new unity". Which meant that art (or a new kind of art) should be the reference point of all design activities: “The ultimate aim of all creative activity is a building! The last goal of the Bauhaus is the unity of arts”</i></div><p>After all of her education, Deborah received a Doctorate of Humane Letters and a BFA in visual arts and acting at Bard College. She learned many things from the various colleges she went to. She learned a lot about color and language, and how the two interact. She learned that language can inform color choices, and vice versa. At the Art Students League, Deborah learned that she could make art for arts sake, since the school offered no degrees. She was there to create art, not to get a degree for a future job.</p></div><div class="image-holder"><div class="image1"><img src="https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2012/11/dezeen_Ulm-School-of-Design_2a.jpg"><p class="caption"><i>Ulm School of Design</i></p></div></div></div>')

var $california = $('<div class="cover"><div class="x"><img src="http://www.iconsdb.com/icons/preview/white/x-mark-xxl.png"></div><div id="date4"></div><div class="text-holder"> <h1>1960’s – Charles and Ray Eames </h1><p>Deborah started her career with Charles and Ray Eames. Charles and Ray were husband and wife. They worked together on modern architecture, furniture, industrial/graphic design, fine art, and film. Charles is actually a college dropout: he left after two years because his ideas were too modern for the university. Ray definitely had a huge influence on Deborah, being another woman in design. She helped Deborah enter the industry more confidently and ensured gender equality at the Eames office.</p><p>Deborah worked with the Eameses from 1953 to 1957, and again from 1961 to 1967. She was very happy to be working there, but also very scared. She was only 22 years old, and working with some of the best designers in the world. During her time at the studio, she created more and more personal work and eventually decided to leave to create her own studio.</p><div class="it"><i>“While the foundation for her later work was laid during the Eames years, she is best known for the body of work she built within her own design practice”</i></div><p>At the Eames office, Deborah worked on many different things, including exhibitions, films, packaging, and toys. She did a graphic illustration for an ad for the Eames chair, which was an iconic piece of furniture designed by Charles and Ray. The chair is still in production today, and is sold by Herman Miller. Deborah describes her time at the Eames office as very valuable to her. She also worked on the seminal exhibits for IBM, the Government of India, and the Ford Foundation.</p><div class="it"><i>“Deborah Sussman was not one to fade into the background; she brought vivid color to her life and work. A fearless proponent of going against the norm and one of the first female graphic designers to rise to the top of her field, she didn’t allow her design to be overshadowed by it’s context. In what was termed environmental graphic design, she took graphics, color and typography, and applied them to architecture and public spaces, making them the center of attention.”</i></div><h1>1960-1980– Sussman and Company; Sussman Prezja</h1><p>Deborah formed her own studio, Sussman and Company, in 1968. Later on, in 1980, it was renamed to Sussman/Prezja to include her husband, Paul Prezja. Paul was an architect, which helped Deborah get into environmental design. His presence also helped bring Deborah into contact with the male dominated architecture and design establishment, which Deborah described as:</p><div class="it"><i>“The old boys club of designers in Los Angeles...They got all the jobs. They did all the work. They were the elite.”</i></div><p>Having these new contacts and clients boosted Deborah’s name in design and really opened up lots of doors for her. Even though the designers she was working with probably didn’t expect much of her, her experience in color design and graphic design impressed everyone and she rose to the top.</p>Sussman/Prezja is known for creating “urban poetry”, and works to create seamless integration of graphic design with architecture and public space. Deborah’s design skills teamed with Paul’s architectural skills let the team create many incredible environmental graphic work. Here, Deborah talks about what “supergraphics” are:</p><div class="it"><i>“Sussman often characterized her own work as “supergraphics:” large-scale, brightly colored designs that shaped the built environment and brought the urban landscape to life often more powerfully than architecture itself. “The idea of supergraphics was not that it was just ‘big’ but that it was ‘bigger’ than the architecture,” she said in a 2013 interview with Creative Review. “It didn’t have to fit in to prescribed spaces in a traditional way. It could have its own life and go beyond the ceiling, be cropped, be as though it had almost flown over the architecture.” That might mean a giant orange star planted on top of a building at the Olympic Arts Festival, or a massive yellow-and-orange X installed on the wall of a department store. The approach has now become mainstream, but in Sussman’s time, it was pioneering”</i></div><h1>1980&#39s – Los Angeles Summer Olympics</h1><p>One of Deborah’s best known works, the identity for the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympics, brought her name forward in the industry and put the spotlight on her. It also put her in a leadership role, which was very different than what she was used to. She was in charge of over 150 designers, most of which were men. She recalls an early presentation she made to all the designers she was leading:</p><div class="it"><i>“I had selected this palette of color and here I am this little female telling them what colors they had to use, and they were all sort of stone-faced … And they said, but where’s the gray? We need gray with those colors.”</i></div><p>Despite the critiques, Deborah’s vision for the Olympic identity prevailed, and helped shape not only the identity for the games, but for the city of Los Angeles. Her design was iconic. Although many people didn’t believe she could do it, Deborah showed that she could hold her own in the graphic design industry. She used graphic design to emphasize the environment and connect it to the culture and community of the event. Another example is her 12x92 foot carpet that she designed for the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, which used colors and motifs from African fabrics to represent the culture.</p><div class="it"><i>“Although environmental graphic design started as architectural signage—hence, graphics—a flat discipline turned out to be inadequate in a round world. An exhibition, for example, is more than a book on a wall or an arrangement of artifacts under glass. It is the engagement of people as they move through space. Sussman/Prejza carries this engagement into stores and other public spaces, and into designed events—a contextual approach that brought the company international renown with the 1984 summer Olympics.”</i></div><p>There was a strong influence of the Eameses on her environmental graphics for the 1984 Summer Olympics. There was a vibrant pallete of colors, simple shapes, and bold icons which expressed the international essence of the games.</p><div class="it"><i>“The brief for the LA Olympics was to achieve maximum impact with minimum means, after the vast overspend of the Montreal games in 1976 and the low attendance at Moscow in 1980. It was the first Olympics designed for television, so Sussman, working with architect Jon Jerde, the king of shopping malls, deployed tricks from Hollywood and retail to create a pop-up city. There were pasteboard triumphal arches and nylon canopies, banners strung across scaffolding and columns fashioned from painted cardboard shipping tubes. It was all temporary, doing away with the costly structures that most Olympics leave as redundant relics in their wake.”</i></div></div><div class="image-holder"><div class="image1"><img src="http://www.eamesoffice.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/charles-ray-eames.jpg"><p class="caption"><i>Charles and Ray Eames</i></p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/5HRjy2J.jpg?1"><p class="caption"><i>Deborah and her husband, Paul</i></p><img src="http://www.trbimg.com/img-52ca38a9/turbine/la-et-cm-deborah-sussman-review-20140106"><p class="caption"><i>A piece of the environment that Deborah designed and delegated for the Los Angeles Olympics</i></p></div></div></div>')

When she worked on the Eames film “Day of the Dead” in 1957, she went to Mexico for inspiration and fell in love with it. She took many pictures that showed up in the film, including the title page. She said that this trip influenced her color choices for the 1984 olympics. This wasn’t the only trip that influenced her color choices, as described by her in this quote:</p><div class="it"><i>“The colors that I selected for the Olympics reflected the colors of celebration I’d seen on the Pacific Rim: Mexico, India, Japan. In India they have these giant structures made of bamboo that get burned up. The memory of those things and the color, and the fact that they were having a revival in so many ways, they were all selected for a reason. They weren’t selected just because they’re beautiful. That color combination expressed the qualities of the culture.”</i></div><p>Her colors were not chosen from one specific point in her life, but a mashup of a variety of sources. This is what set her color design above everyone else. Rather than picking colors arbitrarily, she found inspiration in cultural experiences. This is what set her apart; her colors had meaning behind them. Even though they were bright and bold, they were bold for a reason.</p><div class="it"><i>“Although environmental graphic design started as architectural signage—hence, graphics—a flat discipline turned out to be inadequate in a round world.

She has a retrospective, “Deborah Sussman Loves Los Angeles”, which exhibited her work from the Eames Studio up until the 1984 olympics. One of her projects were gift bags for the Los Angeles Museum of Art, as detailed here:</p><div class="it"><i>“It’s here that LACMA rediscovered Sussman’s exceptional gift bags. With their exquisite (colored by her travels abroad, namely for the Nehru project) patterns positioned differently across various sized bags, the project is one that exemplified the influence of the play and folk art from the Eames Office. It’s here that LACMA rediscovered Sussman’s exceptional gift bags. With their exquisite (colored by her travels abroad, namely for the Nehru project) patterns positioned differently across various sized bags, the project is one that exemplified the influence of the play and folk art from the Eames Office.”</i></div><p>Deborah and Paul’s later work included lots of identity systems for cities and parks. Some of her clients included the Seattle Opera House, the identity and exhibits of the Museum of the African Diaspora (MoAD) in San Francisco, the city-wide image program for Santa Monica, California, and graphics programs for the Walt Disney Company theme parks. Her color and typography skills got her all kinds of jobs in environmental graphic design.</p><div class="it"><i>“To say she was a leader in the industry sounds so cliche. She WAS the industry. She laid the groundwork for every woman who now leads a design office that focuses on Environmental Graphic Design. She has inspired all of us to do better work, never settle, strive for and achieve excellence, and be a champion for great design around the world.”</i></div><div class="it"><i>“Sussman’s specialty was bringing out the graphics in an environment at large, which could mean anything from a museum identity or exhibit design, to wayfinding systems for parks both city and theme, to interiors and commercial spaces. She paired with some of the most famous architects of the day, figures like Frank Gehry, SOM, and Philip Johnson among others. But just because she collaborated, didn’t mean that she let her vision and style be overruled.”</i></div><p>Starting with Walt Disney, Sussman and Prezja worked on the signage, wayfinding, print, and vehicular graphics. Walt Disney World is a huge park, and visitors can only arrive by highway or freeway. S&P had to design a signage system that could be unique, clean, easy to follow, and capable to expand as the park expands. The park was divided into separate districts, and a hierarchy of signs were designed to lead visitors to a district, and then to a specific location. The 1,000 sign system includes large freeway signs, major and minor road directionals, regulatory signs, gateways, and bus graphics. For Euro-Disney, it was a little bit different. The wayfinding system for pedestrians included directional signs, tram signs, and regulatory signs that assisted pedestrians traveling between the lakefront hotels and the theme park. There were also information points with maps at key locations.</p><p>S&P Also worked on “Direction Philadelphia” which was for the identity, signage, and wayfinding in the city of Philadelphia. For their client, Foundation for Architecture / City of Philadelphia, S&P designed a vehicular directional signage program for the city, intended for visitors coming to the city by car. The signage guided them to all kinds of landmarks, including major cultural institutions, universities, parks, and historic places. The colors chosen were meanr to reflect Philadelphia’s colonial role as the “cradle of the revolution” and home of the American flag.</p><p>The City of Santa Monica commissioned Deborah and Paul to create the identity, signage, wayfinding, and vehicular graphics for the city. They designed the new city logo, the redesign and replacement of all street signs, and a graphic program for city vehicles (including the Big Blue Bus). The Big Blue Bus is a municipal bus operator that provides transit in Santa Monica and adjacent cities in Los Angeles, including LAX. It is considered one of the best bus services in the Los Angeles area, winning the American Public  Transportation Association’s Outstanding Transportation System award in 1987, 1992, 2000, and 2011. This great success can be attributed to the great design of the vehicle graphics, which S&P designed. The entire new identity of Santa Monica helped distinguish the region from the surrounding Los Angeles communities.</p><p>The New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark, NJ needed a new interior, which included the identity, signage, amenities, architectural colors, and donor recognition. S&P had $180 million to make it happen, and they created all of the graphic identity, logo color and interior design, signing, architectural amenities, and stationary. The identity took inspiration from the city’s cultural composition and explored African culture and well as classic typography.</p><p>On the website of the NJPAC, they describe their mission statement as:</p><div class="it"><i>“The New Jersey Performing Arts Center, by celebrating diversity, shall be America’s foremost urban presenter of arts and entertainment, a creative and effective leader in arts education for children, a convener of useful and enlightening civic engagement events, and a catalyst for economic development in its home city of Newark.”</i></div><p>Deborah surely took this mission statement into consideration when designing the graphics for the building. Deborah’s cultural influence is represented in many of her works, and is one of her strongsuits.</p></div><div class="image-holder"><div class="image1"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/a7cVF46.jpg"><p class="caption"><i>Interior of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center</i></p></div></div></div>')

The design had to complement both the historic Powell Library, one of UCLA’s oldest buildings, as well as the newly constructed Darling Law Library. Deborah and Paul decided to choose a clean, modernist design that was basic in form and relied on sophisticated typography, simple geometric form, and color coding for easy access and understanding.</p><p> The City of Long Beach got S&P to design their identity, pageantry, signage, and wayfinding for the city, as described on their website:</p><div class="it"><i>“Queensway Bay was the first phase of an aggressive urban development in Long Beach, California, home of the Queen Mary and the Aquarium of the Pacific. Consisting of approximately 69 acres of dedicated parkland and 3.5 miles of waterfront, the project is, in the truest sense, a civic destination. It offers the public a beautiful waterfront park with a wide variety of free recreational opportunities. Sussman/Prejza’s work includes: district identity for Queensway Bay, street-scape pageantry design, major and minor vehicular directionals for the downtown area, and symbol sign trailblazers for the major downtown attractions.”</i></div><p>This was another huge project for Deborah and Paul, and they once again were able to show their mastery of environmental graphic design and how it relates to form and content.</p><p>Deborah also designed the Universal CityWalk in Orlando, Florida. In this project, they wanted to approach it by highlighting the Florida locale as well as create a language for the street experience. They created multi-layered, “tropical” supergraphics which introduced verticality, bright lights, and graphic playfulness to the public space. Abstract forms were combined with hardware to create functional compositions along the walkway. The designs included the skyline towers, hybrid totem fixtures and banners, shade canopies, directional signs, and tenant identity programs.</p><p>SP&CO designed the wayfinding and exhibitry for Hancock Park in Los Angeles, California. “Home to both the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Page Museum of La Brea Discoveries, Hancock park is a natural historic site where science and art are combined in a public setting”(Sussmanprejza.com). Deborah and Paul worked with the scientists to create an identification, wayfinding, and instructional signage system for the park. The signs guide visitors through the park, and also explain the tar pits in the six excavation points around the park.</p><p>One client was Bard Graduate Center in New York, New York. The project was to design an exhibition for Women Designers in the USA from 1900-2000. A summary of the project is described on their website:</p><div class="it"><i>“Sussman/Prejza designed the Context Line in the exhibit Women Designers in the USA, 1900-2000: Diversity & Difference, as well as the printed version in the accompanying book. The purpose of the timeline was to impart a sense of its subject as well as document the contents of the exhibition in the context of women’s social, cultural and political history. Therefore, it is physically fluid and printed digitally on translucent fabric that moves gently in response to the viewer, and floats over large photographic icons of each decade.”</i></div><p>Since Deborah came out of an era where woman were underestimated in the design industry, getting this job was very important to her.</p><p>A more recent client was A+D Museum in Los Angeles, California, and the project was something very important to Deborah. It was an exhibition dedicated to Charles and Ray Eames. They were responsible for creating the exhibit design, as described here:</p><div class="it"><i>Charles and Ray Eames inspired us to appreciate the world by honoring “the uncommon beauty of common things.” This exhibit uses quotes by the Eames to focus on the lesser-known aspects of their lives, revealing their appreciation of the value of humble objects and useful tools. Their insights about the simple pleasures of daily life are illustrated with objects and materials available during their lifetimes and contemporary examples from the world around us. The intent of the ‘Eames Words’ exhibition was to allow the guest the opportunity to ‘take in’ the philosophy, and ideas of Charles and Ray Eames while at the same time being surrounded by the everyday items that inspired them. The glass facade of the museum features the word EAMES in 8ft high three-dimensional black letterforms. Visitors enter through doors featurinsg the letters A and S; the letter M extends onto the pavement outside, while both the letter Es extrude into the museum space - creating three 18ft long display units.</i></div></div><div class="image-holder"><div class="image1"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/l1tOYcT.png"><p class="caption"><i>Hancock Park – Civic Wayfinding and Exhibit Signing</i></p></div></div></div>');

A devoted traveller and gifted scavenger, she scoured the world for images, ideas, and colors that she then wove through her work for municipalities, for developers, for architects, for institutions. She was a master of the grand gesture and also of the details. Her work sparkles, it delights, it’s downright beautiful. Her design program for the fabled LA Olympics looks as fresh today as it was the moment she designed it over 30 years ago.”</i></div><p>Something interesting about the way Deborah designs is the fact that she doesn’t always give the client exactly what they ask for:</p><div class="it"><i>“Several people have told me over the years ‘just give them what they want’ with regards to clients, and I can’t bring myself to do it,” Sussman said in a 2013 interview with Designboom. “I have to inspire them, and that can sometimes be a very dangerous attitude to have because you can lose yourself a lot of money.”</i></div><p>This quote shows the confidence that Deborah gained as a designer throughout her lifetime, and it is great to see. Just because she’s a woman in design doesn’t mean that she has to do what everyone tells her to.</p><p>Her connection to AIGA is very important to her. She founded the AIGA Los Angeles chapter with Ed Fella and other designers, and is a former board member.</p><p>Deborah passed peacefully at her home in West Los Angeles after a long battle with breast cancer. Her husband, Paul Prezja, was at her side. She was 83 years old. Her vision, talent, and personality have inspired countless others. The design community experienced a tremendous loss that day, although her legacy will live on forever. The essence of her life was summed up in this quote:</p><div class="it"><i>“Recalling my experiences of Deborah is in some ways an easy task. Her spirit and her personality were as vivid as the colors and images she used throughout her decades-long career as an environmental graphic designer. A celebration of Deborah is as much a tribute to her life as it is her body of work. My last visit with Deborah was over dinner at Musso & Franks Grill, the famed Hollywood watering hole. Over a plate of sand dab fillets and with cocktail in han, Deborah shared her pungent thoughts about the contemporary LA design scene and her reflections on LA design in decades past. It was a classic Deborah evening, watching an LA icon conjure up past and present in a room that has witnessed so much Hollywood history.<br>Deborah Sussman had an amazingly long run. While the foundation of her career was laid during her stints in the office of Charles and Ray Eames, the glorious body of work that is the true Deborah Sussman experience was undertaken at her own design practice which she started in 1968. A devoted traveler and gifted scavenger, she scoured the world for images, ideas, and colors that she then wove through her work for municipalities, for developers, for architects, for institutions. She was a master of the grand gesture and also of the details. The work sparkles, it delights, it’s downright beautiful, and there is so much of Deborah in the work. Her design program--the kit of parts--for the fabled LA Olympics looks as fresh today as it was the moment she designed it over 30 years ago. When we honored Deborah as SEGD Fellow in 1991, she gave a presentation that raised a few eyebrows. It was a classic Deborah moment. Rather than present the usual review of her work and her office, she gave us a tour of her very own LA, the personal landmarks of her daily life. It was a beautiful window into the spectrum of her life and the things that sustain her, so much more interesting than a slide show of projects.<br>As a woman forging a bold path in what can too often be a man’s world, Deborah so often seemed supremely confident and crystal clear in her ideas and opinions. Once when we found ourselves in Miami Beach at the same time, I caught Deborah Sussman in a fleeting moment of uncertainty. I was lounging poolside with Deborah and her sister Janet at the Delano Hotel. Deborah was wearing a fantastic bathing suit, a feast of colors that only Deborah could conjure up. Suddenly across the pool deck there was a buzz. Giorgio Armani was arriving with his entourage. He was, of course, wearing simple black trunks. Deborah quickly caught wind of this new image at the pool and Janet and I had to restrain Deborah from running upstairs to put on her black suit; of course she had packed options. The woman was human; few can remain immune to the power of the Armani image, in this case in the flesh. But the Sussman image prevailed and we passed the rest of the afternoon with Deborah in her suit of many colors.<br>And so dear Deborah, I remember so much: the glasses, the socks, the beautiful typefaces, the rich colors, some amazing dresses, so much beautiful work, and your sparkling vivid presence.”</i></div><p>Deborah left a massive hole in the community when she passed away, and the legacy of her work has been immortalized in an exhibition of her work entitled “Deborah Sussman Loves Los Angeles!” which was funded on Kickstarter. Some of her work has been reproduced as gift bag and are being sold at the exhibition.</p><p>Overall, Deborah has helped define me an a designer and given me a lot of inspiration for future endeavors. Since color is a very large part of my identity, I want to make sure my color choices are as bold and meaningful as Deborah’s. I hope that one day I can become as influential and prolific as Deborah.</p></div><div class="image-holder"><div class="image1"><img src="http://designobserver.com/media/images/38559-DebSussman_0277-NOWatermark.jpg"><p class="caption"><i>Deborah Sussman</i></p></div></div></div>');
