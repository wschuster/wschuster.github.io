    <h1>Signal</h1>
<p>When starting this project we thought about the way that nuclear warfare is so flippantly talked about by world leaders as of late. There is a severe lack of education and understanding regarding the implications of a nuclear disaster. We start our story by looking at the past; we looked at the psychological and physical scars that were left on the state of Japan after the atomic bombs were dropped on Fukushima and Nagasaki. The people of Japan never quite recovered.</p>

        <h1>Implications</h1>
        <p>After the nuclear bombs were dropped a discriminative term was born, called “Hibakusha” which means “explosion effected people”. The victims of nuclear radiation often had bad burns or scarring, which people thought was contagious or a mutation. Those labelled Hibakusha are outcasted from society and it is often very hard for them to live normal lives when it comes to things like jobs and relationships. The term Hibakusha has been revived in Japanese culture due to the 2011 Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear disaster and <b>people are facing the same discrimination once again.</b><br><br>

The driving factor behind discrimination is misinformation. We decided to raise awareness on nuclear energy and emergency preparedness by speculating a future where the government has put emergency evacuation kits in place to make sure the people know exactly what to do if a nuclear disaster were to occur again.</p>

    <div class="textbox">
        <h1>The Kit</h1>
        <p>We decided that the best way to raise awareness and preparedness would be to implement a standardized kit for all residents. The kit would be installed into the home where all members of the household would be instructed of its use. The kit’s compartments break down into 3 different zones, based off of the amount of radiation you’re recieving. The amount of radiation you are receiving is monitored by a personal detection device. <br><br>We have speculated that in our future every resident will have a personal detection device integrated into an everyday device or piece of clothing. When radiation levels become too high your detection device will alert you and your kit, which will unlock the corresponding compartments you need to survive the evacuation.</p>

    <div class="textbox">
        <h1 style="color:#fcc152">Zone 1</h1>
        <p>Zone 1 is yellow. The event is pretty insignificant and you are only exposed to slightly higher radiation levels than normal. This compartment contains a mask and suit to protect from harmful alpha and beta radiation particles.

    <div class="splash box4"></div>
    
    <div class="textbox">
        <h1 style="color:#F15A29">Zone 2</h1>
        <p>Zone 2 is orange. A Zone 2 event is destructive and you are exposed to high amounts of radiation that could cause radiation sickness within 3 days. This compartment contains a multi-tool, bleach to purify drinking water, and iodine tablets to prevent the development of thyroid cancer.

        <div class="textbox">
        <h1 style="color:#FF0000">Zone 3</h1>
        <p>Zone 3 is red. If you survive an event of this magnitude <b>you have been exposed to fatal levels of radiation.</b><br><br>
One of the most challenging aspects came to us when we determined the mortality rates of the zones. In zone 3 you are exposed to fatal amounts of radiation and the only solution is death. How do we make facing imminent death ethical? Do we attempt to comfort those who are going to die a painful and slow death from radiation poisoning? Do we encourage them to end their life with a painless and fast acting poison, albeit controversial? We ultimately decided that the objects for zone 3 should be things that people enjoy, but infused with cyanide to give people one last worldly comfort before they pass on.

        <h1 style="color:#FF0000">Cyanide infused Gummy Bears</h1>
        <p>We had to ask, what about children? Adults will not be the only ones affected by a nuclear disaster. How could we make it easier for children to end their lives, even if they don't fully understand what they are doing? The child-safe bottle has instructions on the side for dosage for a parent or legal guardian to dispense.

<div class="textbox">
        <h1 style="color:#FF0000">Other Options</h1>
        <p>Not everyone finds comfort in the same thing, so we came up with a variety of cyanide infused products to ease the victims into the reality of taking your own life instead of suffering from radiation sickness.

<div class="textbox">
        <h1 style="color:#FF0000">Morphine Injection</h1>
        <p>We also thought about people who are already in immense pain from radiation burns or advanced stages of sickness. Morphine is a powerful painkiller that is lethal in high doses. If a person was to inject themselves with enough morphine, they would experience a euphoric high before they fall asleep and pass away.
