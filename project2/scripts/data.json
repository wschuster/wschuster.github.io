The room also acted as a gym/large storage area/ little kid church daycare area, and I remember when we walked in the room on Easter, it was only lit from light coming through the windows, so it was fairly dark. I remember when we first walked into the room, there were a lot of people in folding chairs, and I was looking at these big wooden sets, like for puppet shows, leaning against the wall, and I asked my mom what they were and she said something along the lines of \"they're for the show after mass\" and that's really all I remember. I don't even remember mass or the puppet show after."

    "firstmemory": "It was the morning of my third birthday and I'd just woken up. And I was SO excited, because birthday, and so clearly the thing to do was ignore every time my parents had ever told me to jump on my bed. I actually remember a lot of the details pretty well—the Pooh Bear bedspread and pillows, the pink walls... or carpet, maybe? There was some Pepto-Bismol pink in there; it was the nineties. I had this white vinyl and mesh guard rail on one side of the bed to keep me from falling out, because I was a pretty active kid in my sleep, and my music box was clipped onto it. Said music box had two modes: one that only played (Brahm's Lullaby, in these super digital tones) when you pushed the button on the top right, and one where it would automatically start playing if it heard a high-pitched noise, like a baby crying. Somehow it had gotten switched to the latter. Jumping on the bed made it squeak, the squeaking happened to be the right pitch to set this thing off, and I must have jumped a solid three feet the air out of sheer terror when Brahm's Lullaby started blaring unexpectedly. When I realized what had happened I broke down laughing, heart still pounding a mile a minute. It was probably around six in the morning.\t"

Never had any physical abuse issues, but in my earliest memory I can remember sitting in my dad's chair, he was not home, I was playing on an etch a sketch. My mother was pacing around, worried about him telling me it was alright and that he'd be home soon. That went on for a long time. He did come home though, burst in through the front door, kicked the door in because he didn't have his keys or some shit. I started crying, of course. He was barely standing, holding on to the door he had just destroyed to keep him up, and he looked at me and asked what I was crying for, and told me it would be me one day too, that it ran in the family. He passed out. Of course I thought he was dead, so I'm screaming my ass off. My mom finally comes in and starts trying to wake my dad up. Literally just anger and sadness just pouring out of her mouth screaming trying to get this dude awake. She got him up though. She threw a bag at him, im assuming it had all of his personal stuff, and yelled at him to leave. Told him to never come back. So he left, he slammed the door so hard that one of the cabinets filled with these little ceramic figures came off the wall. Huge cabinet, lots of shit. Just on the floor in pieces. My mom got down on the floor and put her head on the carpet and screamed, over and over. My oldest brother came and got me. I had me legs tucked to my chest, holding myself. He picked me up and took me to the next room. And i sat there with all my brothers and sisters, just staying quiet while my mom was just fucking wailing in the other room. Shitty, but literally that's the earliest thing I can remember."

I was totally exhilarated to be on that bike...MY bike!!! I loved that bike, it had plastic streamers attached to the handle grips that just flew in the wind. The feeling of freedom and the wind in my hair racing around the neighborhood on my new bike. Makes me so happy remembering that first bike."

I remember sitting at the top of a slide and looking at this wall (I remember it was light and uh kind of rough? If you hit it too hard, you'd hurt yourself) where a ladybug was walking. Then, my \"friend\" just killed it. He killed the bug. I was so upset at the time!!! And mad. Why would he do that? I must've lectured him or something (parents say I used to lecture people lol) but I don't remember much after he crushed the bug :^( (sorry about the bad English and rather poor narrative, it's not my native language)"

The house we had was big and the was a spiral staircase that started in a guest room and lead straight to the kitchen. There was a green swing that hung from the top step, but I was never tall enough to reach it. I remember one day my dad visited us and brought a HUGE watermelon and told me he grew it and that's why he was gone so long, then he apologized. He carried me down the spiral stairs and into the kitchen where he cut the watermelon into wedges and gave a piece to me. Then he said something about \"magic\" something and sprikled salt onto my watermelon? idk but it tasted great and while I was eating he walked to the swing and pushed it. I heard him start to say something but mom called and he walked out of the room. everything else isn't that clear, but I remember watching the swing go back and forth and I remember hearing arguing in the other room. I knew something was wrong but I just kinda sat there. Salt on watermelon tasted good. I remember thinking \"im going to forget this\" and then I promised myself I wouldn't."

    "firstmemory": "Technically, it was was the day my cousin was born, but I don't remember any of that. I do remember being in a weird, clean room with a lot of blue and gray (the waiting room) on the sofa, and trying to eat the hard candies in the bowl in front of me on a coffee table. My mom was afraid I'd choke, so she had me try from another bowl some white chocolate pretzels. I was hesitant at first because I didn't get that chocolate could be white but I ate one and then immediately went on to eat the entire bowl."
